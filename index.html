              <p>The Abyssinian /æbisiniən/ is a breed of domestic short-haired cat with a distinctive "ticked" tabby coat, in which individual hairs are banded with different colors.[2] They are also known simply as Abys.[3]</p>
              <br>
              <p>The source of the name is because the first "Abyssinians" exhibited in shows in England were reported to have been imported to England from Ethiopia, whose name was formerly Abyssinia. However, its true origin — according to genetic studies — is likely to have been the coast of the Indian Ocean in parts of Southeast Asia, and its introduction to Abyssinia (and others) was through colonialists and merchants stopping through</p>
              <br>
              <p>Although regarded as comparatively obscure in the past as a breed compared to others, the Abyssinian ranked in 2016 among the top five most popular breeds by The Cat Fancier Association and The International Cat Association</p>

          <p>The Abyssinian /æbisiniən/ is a breed of domestic short-haired cat with a distinctive "ticked" tabby coat, in which individual hairs are banded with different colors.[2] They are also known simply as Abys.[3]</p>
          <br>
          <p>The American Curl is a medium-sized cat 5–10 lb (2.3–4.5 kg), and does not reach maturity until 2–3 years of age. Females should be between 5–8 lb (2.3–3.6 kg) and males 7–10 lb (3.2–4.5 kg).</p>
          <br>
          <p>American Curl kittens are born with straight ears, which begin to curl within forty-eight hours. After four months, their ears will not curl any longer, and should be hard and stiff to the touch at the base of the ear with flexible tips. A pet-quality American Curl may have almost straight ears, but showcats must have ears that curl in an arc between 90 and 180 degrees. A 90 degrees is preferable, but cats will be disqualified if their ears touch the back of their skulls.</p>
